** Contributing with scenarii

This is a work in progress. The current todo consists of actually thinking about
which scenarii are missing and implement or fix them.

If you have found a missing scenario for a given form, please do make a
pull-request or just PM me through our mutual channels.

** Contributing to the Source

Found a bug? Please do let me know. Pull requests work best!

Do remember the Python zen, though:

With that being said, you may or may not want to set up your virtual
environment. If you don't know what that is, you probably don't.

Install some kind of Flake8-compatible linter on your editor, then install
the project dependencies.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
